# Pneumonia Detection Application

This project is a machine learning application for detecting pneumonia and other common lung diseases from chest X-ray images. The application uses a convolutional neural network to classify X-ray images into categories. The project also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with PyQt5, allowing users to load and classify images.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a CNN model trained on a dataset of chest X-ray images.
- **Image Classification**: Classifies images according to related diseases.
- **User Interface**: A PyQt5-based GUI for easy image loading and classification.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyQt5
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- pydicom
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
